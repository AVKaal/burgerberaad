# Act With Integrity

 No matter what the business or the size of the company, a basic rule of professional conduct is to act with integrity at all times, particularly when you are doing something that outwardly represents the business for which you work. Be honest and straightforward in business dealings and do things by the book; keep your professional word and don't do business in a cutthroat manner. 

# Be Professional At All Times

Don't walk around the office cussing to other staff members or clients or talk about your personal business in a way that everyone in the office will know. Be professional and keep professional relationships that turn personal on a business level when you are in the office. Remember, you represent the company for which you work, and few things turn a customer or colleague off quicker than a vulgar and unprofessional employee. 

# Maintain A Sense of Impartiality

Never give preferential treatment to clients because of a personal relationship or allow an employee perks over another just because he happens to be your Saturday morning golf buddy. It is important to act fairly in business, because once you give the impression that you are prone to favoritism, particularly among staff, you instantly lose credibility. Maintain your sense of impartiality when dealing with professional matters. 

# Keep Company Business In-House

 Similar to what your mother may have told you about family business, the same thing applies in business. Don't discuss what you know are company-only matters with business outsiders. You never know how your willingness to divulge information may be used against you down the road. If you're unsure of whether or not you can share company news, ask your supervisor; better to ask now and be told "no" than to do it and find out you said something you shouldn't have.
